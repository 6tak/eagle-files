# The littleBits Eagle Files Repository

This repository contains the Eagle boards and schematics for all the littleBits modules.

littleBits circuit designs are made available pursuant to the CERN Open Hardware License Version 1.2.  This means that we publish the design files for those modules right here on github. Sharing this stuff is really important to us because littleBits products are an educational tool. Since the circuit designs for our modules are available, students can learn how they work, right down to a circuit level.  This means that people can play with littleBits modules to learn basic circuits and then come back to them later in their education for a deeper understanding of electronics or engineering.  Our founder, Ayah Bdeir, was also one of the founders of the Open Hardware Summit, a major proponent of Open Source Hardware.
To be clear, other intellectual property rights such as design elements like fonts, white soldermask with purple silkscreen, logos, as well as the modular connection system (including the connectors, the connector system and the system of modular circuits) are reserved by littleBits Electronics, Inc., and we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications related to our proprietary magnetic connectors and our system of electrical circuits.
littleBits is a growing library of pre-assembled electronic circuits that snap together with tiny magnets. Learn more at [littlebits.cc](http://littleBits.cc).
